# Python Services Quick Start

Get up and running with Python microservices in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 20+ (for registry)
- pip


## 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd examples/python-services
pip install requests
```

Or use the setup script(s):

```bash
./setup.sh
```

If that fails with "environment is externally managed" use the virtual environment (venv) setup:

```bash
./setup-venv.sh
```

### 2. Start the Registry

In a new terminal:

```bash
node ./registry.js
```

You should see:
```
Registry server listening on port 3000
```

### 3. Set Environment Variable

```bash
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Run Your First Python Service

```bash
./simple-service.py
```

You should see:
```
Starting simple Python service...
Registry URL: http://localhost:3000
✓ Service 'simple-service' is running at http://localhost:3001
Press Ctrl+C to stop...
```

### 5. Test It!

In another terminal:

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/call \
  -H "yamf-command: service-call" \
  -H "yamf-service-name: simple-service" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "World"}'

# Expected response:
# {"message": "Hello, World!", "service": "simple-service", "received": {"name": "World"}}
```

Or use the Python test client:

```bash
python test-client.py
```

## What's Next?

### Try Service-to-Service Communication

Start multiple services and have them call each other:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Registry
node ./registry.js

# Terminal 2: Simple service
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
./simple-service.py

# Terminal 3: Service that calls other services
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
./service-with-calls.py

# Terminal 4: Test
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
python -c "
from yamf import call_service_sync
import os
os.environ['YAMF_REGISTRY_URL'] = 'http://localhost:3000'
result = call_service_sync('service-with-calls', {'callService': 'simple-service'})
print(result)
"
```

### Try Pub/Sub Messaging

```bash
# Terminal 1: Registry
node ./registry.js

# Terminal 2: Subscriber
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
./standalone-subscription.py

# Terminal 3: Publish messages
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
python -c "
from yamf import publish_message_sync
import os
os.environ['YAMF_REGISTRY_URL'] = 'http://localhost:3000'
publish_message_sync('user-events', {'userId': 123, 'action': 'created'})
print('Message published!')
"
```

### Try Mixed Language Services

Run Node.js and Python services together:

```bash
./run-mixed-example.sh
```

This starts both Node.js and Python services and tests inter-language communication!

## Common Issues

### "YAMF_REGISTRY_URL environment variable not set"

Make sure you export the environment variable:
```bash
export YAMF_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### "Connection refused" or "Registry not detected"

Make sure the registry is running:
```bash
node ./registry.js
```

### Port already in use

The registry automatically assigns ports. If you get conflicts, restart the registry.

### "Module not found: yamf"

Make sure you're running from the examples/python-services directory, or install the module:
```bash
pip install -e ../../languages/python
```
